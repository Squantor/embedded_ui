# Small graphical user interface
This PCB is a small graphical user interface with a few buttons.
# HSI (Hardware Software Interface)
This applies to a project that has a embedded software component. Describe what each pin/bus does, what it is connected to, what its function is and some "safe" behaviour when starting up.
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* schematic entry 
* PCB layout
* Review with one night in between
* Produce at [OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/)
* Assemble
* Test & characterise
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
## BOM
* The standard aliexpress OLED displays with 128x64 or 128x32 resolution.
* I2C port expander (PCF device)
## Pictures
TODO
