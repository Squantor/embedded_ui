# Embedded User Interface hardware
Electronics for a embedded user interface.
# HSI (Hardware Software Interface)
The user interface is made up with two PCF8574T I2C port expanders. One expander is connected to a 2*16 character LCD and the other to the buttons and a buzzer.
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* Expand the HSI
* Assemble
* Test & characterise
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
